# GoogleCalendarAPI
This uses HTML, CSS, and JS to fetch events from a specific Google Calendar

# Be sure to follow all of these steps
## 1. Enable Google Calendar API
Google Developers Console: This is a tool provided by Google where developers can manage their projects and services. You'll need to visit this console to enable APIs for your project.
Creating a Project: If you haven't already, you'll need to create a new project in the Google Developers Console. This project will be used to manage your API access and credentials.
Enabling the API: Within your project, you'll need to enable the Google Calendar API. This allows your application to interact with Google Calendar.
## 2. Get API Key
Credentials Page: This is a section within the Google Developers Console where you manage access keys and other credentials.
API Key: This is a unique identifier that you'll use to authenticate your requests to the Google Calendar API. You'll generate this key in the credentials page.
## 3. Access the Calendar
Calendar ID: Each Google Calendar has a unique ID that you can find in the calendar's settings. This ID is used to specify which calendar you want to access with the API.
Public Calendar: If you want anyone to view the calendar events without logging in, you'll need to make sure the calendar is set to public.
## 4. Use the API Key and Calendar ID
Making Requests: With your API key and the calendar ID, you can make requests to the Google Calendar API. These requests will fetch data from the specified calendar.
